# Kafka POC - Zomato Delivery Boy & Client Apps
This repository contains the Kafka Proof of Concept (POC) project, which includes two integrated applications: the Zomato Delivery Boy App and the Zomato Client App. These applications demonstrate the use of Apache Kafka for live location updates and continuous tracking of orders using Spring Boot and Spring Kafka.

Key Features:

Live Location Updates: Real-time tracking of the delivery boyâ€™s location.
Continuous Order Tracking: Seamless updates on the order status.
Producer and Consumer Services: Kafka producer services in the Delivery Boy App send location updates, while consumer services in the Client App receive and process these updates in real time.
Spring Boot Integration: Robust and scalable backend services.
Spring Kafka Implementation: Efficient real-time data streaming and processing.
Technologies Used:

Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Kafka
Messaging: Apache Kafka

Outcome:

This project showcases the capabilities of Kafka for real-time data streaming and processing, providing a reliable and efficient solution for live tracking and order management in a food delivery context.
